Files are easy to locate, good names and comments to.
The program is a bit hard to read, because it is a bit messy,
but understandable!. Very good formats on the code,
with good space between equation parts, and good organisation with
functions first and the running part at the end, but could use a bit
less functions.

The program answers the problem in the exercise, but something
in the program is wrong so you get wrong numbers (we did not find
it together). 

 there is some (automatic) verifications of the code.

 I can run the code, a bit work to change between exercises
 and c) is missing but after looking at it, it looks good

 The mandatory exercise is approved from my part.
 it is missing some parts but you have tried and know what u need to
 do and doing in the program.
